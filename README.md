# Periodic Microstructure Model

Microstructures can repeat themselves in a structure in a periodic manner or in an aperiodic manner. Some analytical solutions exist in the literature for periodic microstructures. For instance, [Barbero et al.](#references) developed explicit formulas for a composite reinforced by isotropic, circular-cylindrical fibers, which are periodically arranged in a squared array (see Figure in the paper).

In the following text, we always assume that the fibers are aligned with the x-axis. These fibers are equally spaced with a distance of 2a2 in the direction of the y-axis and with a distance of 2a3 in the direction of the z-axis. For the case of square symmetry, we assume 2a2 = 2a3, leading to 6 unique components for the stiffness tensor.

Let λ_m and μ_m be the Lamé parameters for the matrix, and λ_f and μ_f be the parameters for the fiber material. Let the volume fraction of the fiber be denoted by V_f. The coefficients are written as given by Barbero et al.:

```math
{C^*}_{1111} = λ_m + 2μ_m - (V_f / D) * (S^2_3 / μ_m^2 - (2 * S_6 * S_3) / (μ_m^2 * g) - (a * S_3) / (μ_m * c) + (S^2_6 - S^2_7) / (μ_m^2 * g^2) + (a * S_6 + b * S_7) / (c * μ_m * g) + (a^2 - b^2) / (4 * c^2))

{C^*}_{1122} = λ_m + (V_f * b / D) * ((S_3 / (2 * c * μ_m)) - (S_6 - S_7) / (2 * c * μ_m * g) - (a + b) / (4 * c^2))

{C^*}_{2233} = λ_m + (V_f / D) * ((a * S_7) / (2 * c * μ_m * g) - (b * a + b^2) / (4 * c^2))

{C^*}_{2222} = λ_m + 2μ_m - (V_f / D) * (- (a * S_3) / (2 * μ_m * c) + (a * S_6) / (2 * c * μ_m * g) + (a^2 - b^2) / (4 * c^2))

{C^*}_{1212} = μ_m - V_f * (- (2 * S_3) / μ_m + 1 / (μ_m - μ_f) + (2 * S_7) / (μ_m * (1 - ν_m)))^(-1)

{C^*}_{1313} = μ_m - V_f * (- (S_3 / μ_m) + 1 / (μ_m - μ_f))^(-1)
```

where,

```math
D = (a * S_3^2) / (2 * μ_m^2 * c) - (a * S_6 * S_3^2) / (c * μ_m^2 * g) + (a * (S_6^2 * S_7^2)) / (2 * c * μ_m^2 * g^2) + (S_3 * (b^2 - a^2)) / (2 * μ_m * c^2) + (S_6 * (a^2 - b^2) + S_7 * (a * b + b^2)) / (2 * c^2 * μ_m^2 * g) + (a^3 - 2 * b^3 - 3 * a * b^2) / (8 * c^3)

a = μ_f - μ_m - 2 * μ_f * ν_m + 2 * μ_m * ν_f

b = -μ_m * ν_m + μ_f * ν_f + 2 * μ_m * ν_m * ν_f - 2 * μ_f * ν_m * ν_f

c = (μ_m - μ_f) * (μ_f - μ_m + μ_f * ν_f - μ_m * ν_m + 2 * μ_m * ν_f - 2 * μ_f * ν_m + 2 * μ_m * ν_m * ν_f - 2 * μ_f * ν_m * ν_f)

g = 2 - 2 * ν_m
```

The constants S_3, S_6, and S_7 for the composite reinforced by long circular cylindrical fibers, periodically arranged in a square array, aligned with the x-axis with a2 = a3 are given in [Barbero et al.]:

```math
S_3 = 0.49247 - 0.47603 * V_f - 0.02748 * V_f^2

S_6 = 0.36844 - 0.14944 * V_f - 0.27152 * V_f^2

S_7 = 0.12346 - 0.32035 * V_f + 0.23517 * V_f^2
```

The tensor C* needs only 6 components because of the square symmetry. This tensor can be transformed into a more general result that would be applicable for transversely isotropic composite material.

Let T be the coordinate transformation matrix, and rotation θ about the x-axis yields:

```math
\ten{B}(\theta) = \ten{T}^T(\theta) \ten{C}^* \ten{T}(\theta)
```

Then the equivalent transversely isotropic tensor is obtained by averaging:

```math
\Bar{\ten{B}} = (1 / π) ∫(0 to π) \ten{B}(\theta) dθ
```

Then, using the relations between the engineering constants and the components of \Bar{\ten{B}}, the following engineering constants can be obtained:

```math
E_1 = {C^*}_{1111} - (2 * {C^*}_{1122}) / ({C^*}_{2222} + {C^*}_{2233})

E_2 = ((2 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2222} + 2 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2233} - 4 * {C^*}_{1122} * {C^*}_{1122}) * ({C^*}_{2222} - {C^*}_{2233} + 2 * {C^*}_{1212})) / (3 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2222} + {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2233} + 2 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{

1212} - 4 * {C^*}_{1122} * {C^*}_{1122})

G_{12} = G_{13} = {C^*}_{1313}

ν_{12} = ν_{13} = {C^*}_{1122} / ({C^*}_{2222} + {C^*}_{2233})

ν_{23} = (({C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2222} + 3 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2233} - 2 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{1212} - 4 * {C^*}_{1122} * {C^*}_{1122}) / (3 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2222} + {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{2233} + 2 * {C^*}_{1111} * {C^*}_{1212} - 4 * {C^*}_{1122} * {C^*}_{1122}))

G_{23} = E_2 / (2 * (1 + ν_{23}))
```
